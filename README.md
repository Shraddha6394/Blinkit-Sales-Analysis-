# ðŸ›’ Blinkit Sales Analysis â€” Python Edition

## ðŸ“Œ Short Description
A Python-based Blinkit sales analysis project, re-created from my earlier SQL version. Used Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data cleaning, KPI calculations, and visualizations to uncover trends by product type, outlet attributes, and location, enabling data-driven insights.

## ðŸ“œ Previous Work
I initially created this project using **SQL Server**:
- Imported & cleaned 8K+ sales records from CSV
- Standardized categorical values (e.g., `LF`, `low fat` â†’ `Low Fat`)
- Wrote 20+ SQL queries for KPIs, product performance, and market segmentation
- You can check the SQL version here: **[SQL Project Link](bit.ly/3Js5bYP)**

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives (Python Version)
- Clean and preprocess Blinkitâ€™s sales dataset using Python
- Explore performance trends by **fat content, item type, outlet attributes, and location**
- Visualize findings for better storytelling and decision-making
