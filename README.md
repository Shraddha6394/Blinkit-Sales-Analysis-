# Blinkit-Sales-Analysis-
A Python-based Blinkit sales analysis project, re-created from my earlier SQL version. Used Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data cleaning, KPI calculations, and visualizations to uncover trends by product type, outlet attributes, and location, enabling data-driven insights.
